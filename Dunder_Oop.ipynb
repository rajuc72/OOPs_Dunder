        "\n",
        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans : Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is nothing but a programming technique which is used to create objects, which can contain data and code that manipulates that data .\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Class is container of OOP concept, it is bundled with attributes and methods. In simple words Class is nothing but blueprint/template to create objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Object is an instance of class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Abstraction is nothing but hiding the complex design , making the program more user friendly.\n",
        "Encapsulation means displaying or showing only necessary information by protecting data integrity . Encapsulation help us to avoid unauthorized access to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Dunder Methods are often called as magical methods and which are predefined methods of python to perform special functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Inheritance is nothing acquiring properties of already existed class  \n",
        "\n",
        "7 What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Poly= Many, Morphisim= forms . It takes many forms which is achieved by using method over loading . Ex: add(a), add(a,b), add(c,b,d)…..\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:ncapsulation is achieved by using class. Class is bundled with variables and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Constructor is a special function which is used to initialize objects. Constructors implicitly executed once the object created. It is the first function to be executed in the class after the object creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Class methods is a function that is bound to a class, not an instance of a class. It used cls as its first parameter. Static methods are special type of function we can access these types of methods without creating the object to that class. It do not use either self or cls as its parameter, and it is direct called by using class name dot funcname.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Method Overloading is nothing but defining multiple methods with the same name but with different number of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Method overriding is nothing but implementing of a method which is already existed with different functionality or as abstracted.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Property Decorator is a built-in tool that allows methods to act like an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Polymorphism mainly helps in writing the flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Abstract class is nothing but a class with empty body , in other words it is a template to implement the logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:  Advantages of OOPs are Data Integrity, Data Consistency, Data Security, Data reusability and data sharing .\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Ans: Class variables are shared by all instances of a class, while instance variables are unique to each instance.\n",
        "18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Deriving a child class from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans Both are built-in dunder methods of python . –str—is used for string representation of class –__repr__ is used to return a clear string representation of an object.\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The super() function is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The __del__() method is used to perform cleanup actions, such as Closing files , Releasing resources or to destruct the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: @classmethod creates a class method, which can access and modify the class state, while @staticmethod creates a static method, which doesn’t modify the class state or data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Polymorphism and inheritance in Python work together to allow child classes to have methods with the same name as their parent class, while also allowing the child class to override methods from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Method chaining is nothing but modify the object in method calling. In-other words method call modifies the object and returns the modified object, which can then be used as the input for the next method call.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: __call__ is a dunder or magic method in python. Which is used to write classes where the instances behave like functions and can be called like a function.\n"
